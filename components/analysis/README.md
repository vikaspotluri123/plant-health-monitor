Computer Vision Subsystem:
There are two parts to this subsystem. The first is the chlorophyll content representation, which is completley given in the git hub.
Secondly, there is a machine learning trained model section, where some information and outputs are avaliable.
I trained the model based of the image dataset given at this link: https://osf.io/p67rz/. This provides 7000 images of diseased corn, along with the labeled annotations in a CSV. I used Tensorflow, which is readily available for download at https://github.com/tensorflow/models. The nueral network trainer I used can be found at this link: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md. I used the Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2. A tutorial that I used that helped me an extreme amount can be found at this link: https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10. I pretty much followed this tutorial step by step to get my end results. However, I did not have to label any images because the dataset that I provided above has done this for you already. Finally, I have provided the final checkpoint from the machine learning model. Put this file in the \tensorflow1\models\research\object_detection\training folder, and export the file into an infrence graph. Steps to do this is described in the tutorial that I provided.
